(defun derive-entry (&rest args)
  "The DERIVE-ENTRY report uses Ledger to intelligently create a new entry for
you.  The possible keywords arguments are:

    :DATE             <DATE-STRING>
    :PAYEE            <REGEXP>
    :ACCOUNT          <REGEXP>
    :BALANCE-ACCOUNT  <REGEXP>
    :AMOUNT           <VALUE-STRING>
    :APPEND           <BOOLEAN>

Except for :PAYEE, all of these keyword arguments are optional.  Here is what
they mean:

  :PAYEE REGEXP
    Find the most recent entry whose payee matches REGEXP, and base the new
    entry derivation on its details.  If no matching entry can be found, the
    payee of the newly created entry will exactly match REGEXP.

  :DATE DATE-STRING
    The date of the new entry will be DATE-STRING, otherwise it is today.

  :ACCOUNT REGEXP
    Set the first account line in the new entry to be the most recently used
    account which matches REGEXP.  If no such account can be found, an account
    named REGEXP is used.  If no account is specified, the account
    \"Expenses:Unknown\" is used.

  :BALANCE-ACCOUNT REGEXP
    Like :ACCOUNT, except this refers to the account used for the second
    transaction in the newly derived entry.  If not specified, a calculated
    \"balance account\" is looked for in the matching entry; if this does not
    apply, the journal's default account is used; if this does not apply, the
    account \"Asets:Unknown\" is used.

  :AMOUNT VALUE-STRING
    The amount of the first transaction.  If it has no commodity, the
    correlated commodity from the discovered entry is used.

  :APPEND BOOLEAN
    If non-NIL, the new entry is written to the same journal where the
    matching entry was found (for a binder that references many journals, this
    is whichever file the discovered entry was in).

  Here are a few examples, using sample.dat as a reference:
